## ðŸ”„ Core Pipeline Components

### 1. Data Pipeline Management

#### Data Ingestion Engine
```yaml
Schedule: 
  - Market Data: Every 15 minutes during trading hours
  - Economic Data: Daily at market close
  - External Factors: As available

Data Sources:
  - LME prices (real-time API)
  - JPX futures (market data feed)
  - US equity data (Bloomberg/Yahoo)
  - FX rates (multiple providers)
  - Economic indicators (FRED, ECB, etc.)

Quality Checks:
  - Missing data detection
  - Outlier identification  
  - Cross-source validation
  - Temporal consistency checks
```

#### Data Preprocessing Pipeline
```python
# Pipeline Structure:
1. Raw Data Validation
   - Schema compliance
   - Data type verification
   - Range checks
   
2. Missing Data Handling
   - Forward fill for prices
   - Interpolation for indicators
   - Model-based imputation for complex patterns
   
3. Outlier Management
   - Statistical outlier detection (3-sigma rule)
   - Economic outlier validation (manual review)
   - Winsorization vs removal decisions
   
4. Feature Store Update
   - Versioned feature engineering
   - Feature lineage tracking
   - Schema evolution management
```

### 2. Training Pipeline Management

#### Training Orchestration
```yaml
Training Schedule:
  - Full Retrain: Weekly (Sunday nights)
  - Incremental Update: Daily
  - Emergency Retrain: On-demand (performance degradation)

Training Infrastructure:
  - Primary: 2x A100 GPUs for transformer models
  - Secondary: CPU cluster for Bayesian models
  - Storage: 10TB+ for model artifacts and logs

Model Training Sequence:
  1. Feature Engineering (2 hours)
  2. Base Model Training (8 hours)
     - Transformer-MAT: 3 hours
     - Bayesian SVAR: 2 hours  
     - LSTM variants: 2 hours
     - Tree models: 1 hour
  3. Ensemble Training (1 hour)
  4. Validation & Testing (1 hour)
```

#### Cross-Validation Strategy
```python
# Time-Series Cross-Validation
def time_series_cv_strategy():
    """
    Custom CV for commodity prediction with:
    - No future data leakage
    - Expanding window approach
    - Stability-focused validation
    """
    
    # Training Windows
    initial_train_size = 365 * 2  # 2 years initial
    validation_size = 90         # 3 months validation
    step_size = 30              # 1 month step
    
    # Stability Metrics
    primary_metric = "sharpe_like_score"
    stability_metrics = [
        "prediction_variance",
        "correlation_consistency", 
        "drawdown_metrics"
    ]
    
    return cv_splits, validation_strategy
```

### 3. Model Management System

#### Model Versioning & Registry
```python
# MLflow Model Registry Structure
model_registry = {
    "base_models": {
        "transformer_mat": "v2.3.1",
        "bayesian_svar": "v1.4.2", 
        "regime_lstm": "v1.8.0",
        "factor_xgboost": "v3.1.0"
    },
    "ensemble_model": "v4.2.1",
    "production_model": "v4.2.0"
}

# Model Metadata
model_metadata = {
    "training_date": "2025-01-26",
    "training_data_version": "v2.1.0",
    "hyperparameters": {...},
    "validation_scores": {...},
    "feature_importance": {...},
    "stability_stats": {...}
}
```

#### A/B Testing Framework
```yaml
Testing Strategy:
  - Champion vs Challenger approach
  - Traffic split: 70% champion, 30% challenger
  - Success criteria: 
    - 5% improvement in Sharpe-like score
    - No degradation in stability metrics
    - 95% confidence level required

Rollout Process:
  1. Shadow testing (1 week)
  2. Canary deployment (10% traffic, 1 week)  
  3. Gradual rollout (30%, 50%, 70%, 100%)
  4. Rollback triggers automatic if performance drops
```

### 4. Inference Pipeline

        self.post_processor = PostProcessor()
        
    def predict(self, market_data):
        # 1. Feature Engineering (< 100ms)
        features = self.feature_pipeline.transform(market_data)
        
        # 2. Ensemble Prediction (< 500ms)  
        raw_predictions = self.model_ensemble.predict(features)
        
        # 3. Post-Processing (< 50ms)
        final_predictions = self.post_processor.apply(
            raw_predictions, 
            constraints=self.economic_constraints
        )
