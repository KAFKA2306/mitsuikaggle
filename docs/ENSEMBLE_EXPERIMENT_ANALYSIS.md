## üöÄ Advanced Ensemble Innovations

### 1. **Dynamic Ensemble Weighting**
```python
# Implemented in experiment framework
def calculate_dynamic_weights(predictions, targets, window=50):
    """Calculate time-varying ensemble weights based on recent performance."""
    weights = {}
    for model in predictions:
        recent_performance = calculate_rolling_correlation(
            predictions[model][-window:], targets[-window:]
        )
        weights[model] = max(0, recent_performance)  # Non-negative weights
    
    # Normalize weights
    total_weight = sum(weights.values())
    return {k: v/total_weight for k, v in weights.items()}
```

### 2. **Uncertainty-Weighted Ensemble**
```python
# Bayesian model averaging approach
def uncertainty_weighted_prediction(model_predictions, model_uncertainties):
    """Weight predictions by inverse uncertainty (higher certainty = higher weight)."""
    weights = 1.0 / (model_uncertainties + 1e-8)  # Avoid division by zero
    weighted_pred = np.average(model_predictions, weights=weights, axis=0)
    return weighted_pred
```

### 3. **Regime-Dependent Ensembles**
```python
# Market regime detection and adaptive weighting
def regime_adaptive_ensemble(predictions, market_indicators):
    """Adapt ensemble weights based on detected market regime."""
    current_regime = detect_market_regime(market_indicators)
    
    regime_weights = {
        'bull_market': {'growth': 0.6, 'momentum': 0.4},
        'bear_market': {'defensive': 0.7, 'volatility': 0.3},
        'sideways': {'mean_reversion': 0.5, 'statistical': 0.5}
    }
    
    return regime_weights[current_regime]
```
