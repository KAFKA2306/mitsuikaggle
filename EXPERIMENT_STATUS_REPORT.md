## üö® Critical Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Execution Environment
**Problem**: Python scripts hanging during execution
**Potential Causes**:
- Memory constraints (8MB files in constrained environment)
- I/O bottlenecks with CSV reading
- Package/dependency conflicts
- Resource limits

**Solutions**:
1. **Memory Optimization**: Use chunked data loading, reduce sample sizes
2. **I/O Optimization**: Convert CSV to parquet, implement streaming
3. **Environment Check**: Verify Python packages, memory limits
4. **Simplified Testing**: Start with tiny datasets (100 rows, 5 targets)

### Issue 2: Complex Framework Overhead
**Problem**: Advanced experiment framework may be too heavy for current environment
**Solutions**:
1. **Simplified Experiments**: Run basic model comparisons first
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Start with 10 targets, scale up gradually
3. **Manual Tracking**: Use simple logging instead of full experiment management

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Environment Resolution (Days 1-2)
```bash
# 1. Diagnose environment constraints
python -c "import psutil; print(f'Memory: {psutil.virtual_memory().total/1e9:.1f}GB')"
python -c "import resource; print(f'Memory limit: {resource.getrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_DATA)}')"

# 2. Test minimal data loading
python -c "import pandas as pd; df=pd.read_csv('input/train.csv', nrows=10); print(df.shape)"

# 3. Install missing packages
pip install torch lightgbm optuna  # if needed
```

### Phase 2: Simplified Execution (Days 2-3)
1. **Minimal Dataset**: 100 rows, 5 features, 3 targets
2. **Basic Comparison**: Independent vs Shared-Bottom models only
3. **Manual Logging**: Simple print statements for results tracking

### Phase 3: Scale Up Gradually (Days 4-7)
1. **Increase Dataset**: 1000 rows, 20 features, 10 targets
2. **Add GNN Approach**: Once basic approaches work
3. **Implement Tracking**: Add experiment management back
